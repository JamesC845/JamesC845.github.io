<div class="tblock">
The New York Air Quality Measurements dataset includes measurements of climatic factors taken from different locations around New York city. The climatic factors of interest for this project are Ozone, Temperature and Solar Radiation. 
<br><br>
Ozone increases in higher temperatures due to the temperature speeding up the rate of of chemical reactions. Therefore, we are expecting Ozone (parts per billion) and Temperature (Farenheit) measures to have a positive relationship. 
<br><br>
Ozone filters Aolar Radiation (measured in Langleys: a unit of radiation named after Samuel Pierpoint Langley), therefore, we are expecting these  variables to have an inversed relationship. 
<br><br>
The first step in creating the model is to determine whether there is a relationship between the variables. This is done by calculating correlations between the variables; the data must be prepeared before this can be done.
<div>









<div class="rblock">
# Check for missing values (NA) in each variable that will be used
<br>
<br>NA %in% airquality$Ozone

<br>
<br>NA %in% airquality$Solar.R
<br>> [1] TRUE
<br>
<br>NA %in% airquality$Temp
<br>> [1] FALSE
</div>

  



<div class="tblock">
The variables Ozone and Solar.R have NAs. Rows of data that have these will need to be excluded so each variable still has same number of values. This is because correlations require all variables are of the same length.
</div>





<div class="rblock">
# Create a subset that excludes the NAs

AQ <- subset(airquality, !is.na(airquality$Ozone))

This shows that the correlation between the Temp and Ozone variables is strong. As previously mentioned, temperature catalyses the chemical reaction that produces Ozone so this was expected.

<div class="tblock">
Surprisingly Solar.R and Ozone have a weak positive relationship of 0.35. Although this is unexpected, a model will still be fitted and diagnosed to determine a potential mathematical relationship between these variables. 
<br><br>
By doing this, if the model appears to show acceptable diagnostic statistics, despite the variables not showing the expected mathematical relationship, this could lead to a new scientific discovery or at the very least warrant further research into this relationship. 
<br><br>
Alternatively, this unexpected finding could simply be due to a flaw in the dataset.

<div class = "tblock">
The next step is to check for outliers. Outliers are values that are unusually far from other values in a dataset.

A model fitted with outliers can lead to a model that makes false predictions.

The Ozone variable is now outlier free. The next step is to check the distribution of the variables. <br><br>
To effectively be used in Linear Regression, all continuous (data that can take any value in a specified range - can be infinite) variables must follow a normal distribution (i.e. when plotted must form a bell curve centered around the mean) and not be highly skewed in any direction. <br><br>
The variables here will be plotted in a density distribution alongside a skewness calculation.

Skewness must fall between -1 and 1 to be considered non-highly skewed. <br><br>
Although Ozone appears to skew to the left, the skewness calcualation is still below 1 so is appropriate for use in 
a regression model. <br><br>
Now that the data is ready to be used in a model, the next step is to fit the model using Ozone as the response variable and both Temperature and Solar Radiation as the predictor variables.
</div>

<div class = "rblock">

# Fit the model <br><br>

AQ.lm <- lm(Ozone~Solar.R+Temp, <br>
             data = AQ) <br><br><br>
# Call the model's summary statistics <br><br>
summary(AQ.lm) <br>

<div class = "routput">
		<img src="https://jamesc845.github.io/images/summary(AQ.lm).png">
</div>


<div class = "tblock">
The model summary shows the p-values are all below 0.05 suggesting both Solar Radiation and Temperature (predictor variables) significantly affect the amount of Ozone (response variable). <br><br>

The Estimate column shows the amount of predicted change in Ozone when the predictor variable increases by 1 (in their respective values). So judging by this model, it is predicted that whenever Solar Radiation increases by 1 Lang, Ozone will increase by 0.04470 ppb and whenever Temperature increases by 1 Fahrenheit Celsius, Ozone will increase by  2.22757 ppb. <br><br>
 These paradigms will form the algorithm provided further diagnostics deem the model acceptable for use. <br><br>


 Because the function of the model is to predict values, a R2 value is calculated. this value shows the correlation (%) between the actual values in the dataset and values predicted by the model. Therefore, a higher R2 that is closer to 1, suggests the model is better at predicting values. <br><br>

This model has an R2 of 0.58 - a model with a R2 of at least 0.5 is generally deemed acceptable for use in scientific research.<br><br>

The next step is to perform a training/test split, a method that tests the effectiveness of the model.

Even with 80% data, the low p-value suggets Temp is having a signficiant effect on Ozone. <br><br>
However the p-value for Solar.R is now above 0.05. The training data version of the model has revealed that the statistical effect the Solar.R has on Ozone is not a strong one. <br><br>
This is unsuprising as these variables were originally expected to have an inverse relationship. <br><br>
Solar.R will now be excluded from the final model. <br><br>
The next step is to diagnose the model's ability to predict values.
</div>


<div class = "rblock">

# Make predictions using the training model paradigms from the corresponding locations in the 20% test dataset <br><br>

By splitting the data 80/20, the 20% data is different to the other 80%. Therefore, if the real data that is new to the model is similar to predictions made by that model, more confidence can be placed in the model's ability to make predictions if these values are similar. <br><br>
Here the correlation shows a strong positive 0.62 which suggests the model is effective at predicting true values.

Now to fit the final model without the Solar.R variable.

The visualisation shows a clear linear relationship between the variables. This plot shows there is a low p-value and an acceptable R2. Furthermore, the estimated change between the two variables is shown here: for every increase of 1 Degree Fahrenheit there is an estimated increase of 2.4391 ppb in Ozone.
<br><br>
In order to thoroughly test the model and determine its effectiveness, an F-Fold Cross-Validation can be performed on the model which uses a technique similar to the 80/20 split.
<br><br>
 When this function is performed, a small fraction of the data is selected randomly and stored into a subset, a new model is built using the larger fraction, then using the predictor variable values from the smaller fraction a set of values are predicted using the paradigms of the model built with the larger fraction.
 <br><br>
 These predicted values are then plotted with lines of best fit.
