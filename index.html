<h2><b>About me and the site</b></h2>

<div class = "tblock">
<br>
My name is James Churchward and I am an aspiring data scientist. I developed this site in order to showcase some projects and demonstrate my skills. <br><br><br>

So far these skills include R programming, fitting and diagnosing Machine Learning Algorithms (Linear & Logistic Regression), data cleaning, text mining and analytics and of course web development. <br><br><br>

I've written the code and the process for each step in a way that can be accessile for programmers and laymen alike, so please enjoy. <br><br><br>

Find the link to the project list at the top of the page.
