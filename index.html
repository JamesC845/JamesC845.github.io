<h2><b>About me and the site</b></h2>

<div class = "tblock">
<br>
My name is James Churchward and I am an aspiring data scientist currently based in the south-west of England. I developed this site in order to showcase some projects and demonstrate my skills. <br><br><br>

So far these skills include fitting and diagnosing Machine Learning Algorithms (Linear & Logistic Regression), data cleaning, text mining, exploratory data analysis, and of course, web development. <br><br><br>

Currently all code in these projects are written in the R programming language and the process for each step is written in a way that is accessile for programmers and laymen alike. So please enjoy. <br><br><br>

Find the link to the project list at the top of the page.
