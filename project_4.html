The Climate Change dataset from the ESRL/NOAA Global Monitoring Division contains information on various  atmospheric factors. The factors focused on in this project are three greenhouse gases: Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methan (CH4) and Nitrous Oxide (N2O). Data is available on the atmospheric concentrations of these gases from May 1983 to December 2008.
<br><br>
The greenhouse gas measurements are expressed in Parts Per Million by Volume (ppmv), For example 2000 ppmv of CH4 would mean the concentration will be 2000 millionths of the total volume of the atmosphere.
<br><br>
For all three gases:
<br><br>

	<ul>
		<li>A time series will be plotted</li>
			<br>
		<li>An Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (ARIMA) model will be fitted to forecast values following the end of the time series</li>
			<br>
		<li>A tab in a dashboard application will be created that can be used to render a plot of a time series with a minimum and maximum forecasted value. This app will be user friendly and will work simply by typing in a number of months to forecast values after the most recent actual value from December 2008.
  </li>

Time series plots simply display values from a single dependent variable. The X axis always represents time. <br><br>

In this case the dependent variables are one of three greenhouse gases and the X axis represents the months between May 1983 and December 2008.  <br><br>

An Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model refers to a range of models that can be used to forecast values based on previous values in a time series. <br><br>

Different ARIMA models can be chosen based on the characteristics of the time series. <br><br>


The Integration (I) aspect of the ARIMA model forecasts values by using the difference between data values throughout the series rather than the values themselves. This way mean and variance can remain consistent throughout - an important factor involved in predictive modelling. <br><br>

The Auto Regressive (AR) aspect of the ARIMA model forecasts values based on actual values and their prior values. Stronger AR characteristics in a series refers to the extent that values and their prior or 'lagged' values correlate to one another.<br><br>


The Moving Average (MA) aspect of the ARIMA model forecasts values based on the interactions between the actual values and the error (AKA residual) values. Stronger MA characteristics in a series refers to the extent that actual values and error values correlated with one another. <br><br>

All of these aspects amalgamate to create an ARIMA model that forecasts values based on the values and characteristics of a time series. <br><br>

Different types of ARIMA models are chosen based on whether a time series exhibits stronger AR and/or MA characteritics. <br><br>

The best ARIMA model can be chosen automatically using a very helpful R function called 'auto.arima()'.

<div class = "tblock">

A helpful diagnostic tool to determine the efficacy of an ARIMA model is an Auto-Correlation Function which can be used on the residuals of an ARIMA model.<br><br>

This will show whether any residual values correlate strongly with other previous/lagged residual values. <br><br>

If a model's residuals correlate with one another this is a sign that there is something non-random affecting the occurence of the errors and that the model has failed to predict why these values are occuring. <br>

The dashed lines represent the confidence interval i.e. the threshold the correlation needs to pass for it to be considered signficant. If the spike passes the dash it is a significant correlation. <br><br>

The correlation at lag zero will always be perfectly positively correlated as the first value is correlated with itsself because at this point there are no lagged values to calculate a correlation. <br><br>

The other correlations, however, are bad news for this model because not only are there are a number of significant ones but these values pulsate forming a pattern. As previously mentioned patterns in residual values are a sign of poor efficacy in a model.

There are less significant correlations in this model and a weak pattern has formed. This is not ideal but does not discredit the model's efficacy too badly.

Although the ACF plots didn't show ideal results for the CO2 and CH4 variables, further tests can be conducted to decide whether the model can be used for effective forecasting.

<div class = "tblock">
The Ljung-Box test examines the null hypothesis of independence in a time series.<br><br>

Here they are applied to the residuals of the ARIMA models to test the extent of independence of its residuals.<br><br>

In other words the purpose of this test is to determine whether dependency between actual values exists; if this test is significant then this will be bad news for the models.

<div class = "tblock">
All Ljung-Box tests have P-values > 0.05 which means the null hypothesis (the series' residuals are independent) is accepted.<br><br>

This means that the model's errors are random and the model can be used to forecast reliably. <br><br>

The next step is to start creating the dashboard.
 </div>
































<br><br><br>






<div class = "tblock">

The dashboard is created using the 'Shiny' package and is created by coding two parts, the user interface and the server. <br><br>

The user interface is what is seen and used by the user and makes up the aesthetics of the app. Most importantly its where the app receives an input.

<br><br>

The server determines how inputs are used and what information is returned.

The user interface will be created first.
